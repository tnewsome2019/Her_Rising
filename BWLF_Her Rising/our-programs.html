                At Her Rising, we believe that empowering women and girls is
                essential to creating a more just and equitable world. That's
                why we offer a range of programs designed to promote gender
                equality, increase access to education, and create economic
                opportunities that support women's independence and autonomy.
                Our education program provides scholarships, mentorship, and
                educational resources to girls in Burkina Faso, while our
                leadership development program is designed to empower women and
                girls to become leaders in their communities. Our economic
                empowerment program focuses on creating opportunities for women
                to build sustainable livelihoods and achieve economic
                independence, and our health and wellness program promotes
                women's health and wellbeing through education and access to
                healthcare services. Through these programs, we are working to
                break down the barriers that prevent women and girls from
                reaching their full potential and build a brighter future for
                all women in Burkina Faso.
