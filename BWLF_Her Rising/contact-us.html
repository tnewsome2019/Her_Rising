                    who might not have had access to education otherwise. We
                    also offer leadership programs that help girls and women
                    develop the skills and confidence they need to become
                    leaders in their communities. Additionally, we provide
                    training, resources, and support to women who are starting
                    their own businesses or pursuing other economic
                    opportunities. We work to improve access to healthcare and
                    other vital resources for women and girls in Burkina Faso.
